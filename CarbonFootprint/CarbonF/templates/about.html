        Carbon footprint is defined as the amount of CO2 and other carbon compounds emitted due to the consumption of
        fossil fuels by a particular person or group. While a variety of sources contribute to the release of these
        gases as shown below, the largest of these is the transportation sector, accounting for 29% of all carbon
        emissions according to the US EPA. It becomes increasingly important to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases
        in order to fight rapid climate change which may have lasting impacts on our society.This website will help you
        track your carbon footprint while travelling between places, and compare different modes of transport to
        minimize your carbon emissions.
